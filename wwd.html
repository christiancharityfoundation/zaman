      <p class="card-text">
        If you empower a women, you empower a nation. Women are the people who are educating the
        next generation and if we make that women can raise their children in a stable and
        healthy environment, we will be helping to raise a more educated and inspired generation
        of Africans. We work with women both in the US and in Africa through a number of programmes designed to improve women's economic, mental and medical well-being. Our programmes in Africa help village women generate a regular income so that they can afford to feed their families, have access to medical care and send their children to school. This in turn triggers a ripple effect of development across small villages and creates a positive impact in communities, contributing to make change happen.

      <h1 class="card-title"><u>WORKING WITH THE YOUTH</u></h1>
      <p class="card-text">
        Young people represent the future of Africa. If we invest in the development of young people early, we prepare them to grow up take over over and improve lives in their communities. In Africa we run our Youth Development Programme to empower and train rural youth in basic IT and Media. They acquire valuable skills valued by employers in today's digital age.Ripples Box can provide the youth the opportunity and access to education and technology that can equip them with skills for adult life. In the US, we encourage global awareness by encouraging young people to learn more about different cultures from around the world. In past years, local youth groups have run their own projectssurrounding topics such as food, music and fashion, which are used to spread a greater understanding and acceptance of world cultures through their community. In addition, young people are welcome to volunteer at our US office for opportunity to learn essential skills and gain experience for future careers.

      <h1 class="card-title"><u>POVERTY ALLEVIATION</u></h1>
      <p class="card-text">
        Nearly a billion people suffer from hunger in the world today, resulting in 3.5 million
        child deaths every year. Life threatening malnutrition is preventable and treatable.
        Our programmes tackle issues, such as hunger and lack of medical care" that African women
        and their children face everyday. By improving the womenâ€™s living conditions we are
        working to alleviate poverty in their community. Spreading our work over a number of
        villages starts a ripple effect of development and growth in communities, and reduces the
        number of people living in extreme poverty in Africa.
